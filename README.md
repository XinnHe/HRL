# Hierarchical Relation Learning for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images
HRL-Hierarchical Relation Learning for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images


## Training base-learners 
Option 1: training from scratch
Download the pre-trained backbones from [resnet50_v2.pth+vgg16_bn.pth](https://github.com/XinnHe/HRL/releases/tag/initmodel%2Fbackbone)

`train_base.sh`

Option 2: loading the trained models

Put the provided models in the `/initmodel`

https://github.com/XinnHe/HRL/releases/tag/initmodel%2FBaseNet%2Fisaid
https://github.com/XinnHe/HRL/releases/tag/initmodel%2FBaseNet%2Fdlrsd
https://github.com/XinnHe/HRL/releases/tag/initmodel%2FBaseNet%2FLoveDA


## Train
 
 `python train.py --shot 1 --split 0 --dataset iSAID --backbone vgg ` 


## Test

 `python test.py --shot 1 --split 0 --dataset iSAID --backbone vgg ` 

During **testing**, please manually set the path of the weights via the `resume_path` argument, for example:  
resume_path ="./weights/best_dlrsd_res50_split0_1shot.pth"

### Weights of HRL

We provide the weights of our model for direct use and reproduction.

## ðŸ“Œ  **NOTE**
If you donâ€™t feel like running HRL yourself, just leave me a message or drop me an email at `xhe@cumt.edu.cn`. Iâ€™ll be happy to **share the HRL visualization results** with you, based on **your visualization style** (blue, red, yellow, green, mask overlays, boundary highlighting, ......).
